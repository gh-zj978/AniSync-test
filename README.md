## :sparkles: Features

Everything you'd want from an AniList client, in one app:

- **Tracking** — obviously. Statuses, scores, progress, notes, and custom lists for your anime and manga.
- **Search & Discovery** — trending, seasonal, and upcoming titles, plus proper filters for when you know exactly what you're after.
- **Media Details** — characters, voice actors, staff, trailers, reviews, recommendations, and where to watch.
- **Feed** — see what your friends are watching and judge them accordingly.
- **Forums** — browse, post, like, and subscribe without ever leaving the app.
- **Stats** — nice charts that prove you watch too much anime.
- **Widgets & Notifications** — airing schedules on your home screen and reminders before episodes drop.

## The FAQ

* *Why isn't the app on the Play Store?*
  * I need MONEY <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/uqa4ad.jpg" width="50" alt="DUTCH"> — and a new laptop or rent matters more to me than handing it to Google.
* *Where do I actually get it, then?*
  * F-Droid or the GitHub releases page — the badges up top link straight to both. That's it. No sketchy APK mirror sites, please.
* *Is it free? Any ads or tracking?*
  * Completely free and open source under GPLv3. No ads, no trackers, no analytics, no telemetry — I don't collect anything about you.
* *Is it safe to log in?*
  * Yep. Login goes through AniList's official OAuth, so the app never sees your password. Your access token is encrypted on-device with AES-256-GCM and only ever talks to AniList's API — nothing else.
* *Why isn't the app on the AniList clients list?*
  * It's a bit complicated, but long story short: a mod told me the app wasn't getting added because the release thread was AI-generated. I rewrote it, let them know, and then didn't hear anything for quite a while. When I followed up recently, the same mod now says the app is vibecoded, so they won't add it. I asked right away how they reached that conclusion — and never heard back again.

  Getting told your first open-source project is "vibecoded" stung, not gonna lie. But whatever. If a mod with actual front-end and back-end experience reviews the app down the line and changes their mind, great; if not, no hard feelings either. I still love AniList :)
* *Why another AniList client? Aren't there enough?*
  * Maybe! But I wanted one that felt genuinely native and looked like a proper Material 3 app. Building it turned out to be way more fun than I expected, so here we are.
* *Found a bug or want a feature?*
  * Open an issue on GitHub. I actually read them and usually reply fast (see the vibecoded saga above). No promises on every feature, but good ideas tend to make it in.
* *Can I help translate?*
  * Please do — AniSync is on Weblate (badge's up top). Pick your language and go, no coding required.
* *Will it ever come to iOS?*
  * Probably not. Compose Multiplatform exists, but I don't want to touch it — every multiplatform app I've tried ran noticeably worse than native Android, since the iOS side wasn't native. Unless I actually learn Swift and SwiftUI (not happening any time soon), it's staying Android-only.
